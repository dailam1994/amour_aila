# UX3 Continuous Improvement Mobile App - AmourAila

- Project provides an online web presence for the client and their customers.
Client and Customers are allowed to login and interact with one another to 
update their personal details that identifies who they are and for them to 
also create records of their previous activities for future reference. This 
helps admin and their employee to obtain information for each customer along 
with what services they recieved previously to understand what services they
should be doing afterwards. Therefore, this will allow employers and employee
to have access to every client's record and have an understanding for the 
next processes in regards to services with the business.
